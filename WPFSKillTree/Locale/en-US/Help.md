# Basics

Welcome to the help section of PoESkillTree. We will start by going over how to use the basic functions.

## Load passive tree from URL

Do you want to load the skill tree of a cool build some one else have done? Or maybe your own from somewhere else? This is how you do it:

* Paste the URL in the **Passive tree link** box and press **Enter** or click **Load Tree** button, and that's it.

You can alternatively import the passive tree of a character through **Home** -> **Import character**.
This dialog also allows importing items, skills and jewels.  
*This feature require you to download data from pathofexile.com!*

## Create build

Lets create a build from scratch!

1. **File** -> **New** -> **New top level build**, **Ctrl+N** or click the corresponding button in the quick access toolbar at left of the title bar.
2. Choose **Class** from dropdown.
3. Set **Level** (this will affect your attributes).
4. Start adding nodes you want.
5. When done, save your build:
   * Press **CTRL+S**
   * From menu: **File** -> **Save** -> **Save current build**
   * From the quick acces bar (on the left side of the title bar): press the corresponding button
   * Open the **Saved builds** panel, right click your build and click **Save**

### Ascendancy

In **View** you can choose to show all the ascendancy trees or just the one you have choosen (this adds a button at the startpoint just like in game).
To change ascendancy class use the drop-down next to the class drop-down. If you show all ascendancy trees it will change automatically when skilling
nodes of another ascendancy class.

## Load Saved build

To load a saved build open the **Saved builds** panel and double-click on the build you want to load.

## Save Modified build

If you did changes to an already saved build and want to save it to the same build use the **Save** option.
If you want to save it as a new build use the **Save As** option (available through the **File** menu, the quick access toolbar or Ctrl+Alt+S).

You can also change the name/note of a build by right-clicking it and selecting **Edit*.

# Items and gems

Now that you have a nice Skill tree, it is time to add some items and gems to calculate your DPS and defences.

## Import character

*This feature require you to download data from pathofexile.com!*

To get item and gem data we are going to access one of your characters from pathofexile.com.
This character needs be equiped with the items and gems that you want for your build, so head over
to the client and fix that.

Once you got your character ready, you can import its items and skills using **Home** -> **Import character**

## Craft and equip items

If you don't have a character to import or want to change your items, open the **Equipment** tab. Here you can see your build's items and your stash.
To change the equipment, drag and drop items from the stash.

To get items into your stash, either craft them in the program (**Home** -> **Craft**) or import existing stash tabs (**Home** -> **Import stash**).

## Edit socketed gems

You can edit the gems socketed into an equipment slot by double clicking that slot (or alternatively through the slot's context menu).
It doesn't have to have an item slotted into it.
