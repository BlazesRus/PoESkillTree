# Basics

Welcome to the help section of PoESkillTree. We will start by going over how to use the basic functions.

## Load Skill tree from URL

Do you want to load the skill tree of a cool build some one else have done? Or maybe your own from somewhere else? This is how you do it:

* Paste the URL in the **Skill tree link** box and press **Enter** or click **Load Tree** button, and that's it.

## Create Build

Lets create a build from scratch!

1. **File -> New** or **Ctrl+N**
2. Choose **Class** from dropdown.
3. Set **Level** (this will affect your attributes).
4. Start adding nodes you want.
5. When done, save your build:
   * Pressing **CTRL+S**
   * From Menu: **File** -> **Save**
   * Open the **Saved Builds** panel and click **Save**

### Ascendancy

In **Edit->Settings** you can choose to show all the ascendancy trees or just the one you have choosen (this adds a button at the startpoint just like in game).
To change ascendancy class use the drop-down next to the class drop-down. If you show all ascendancy trees it will change automatically when skilling points.

## Load Saved Build

To load a saved build open the **Saved Builds** panel and double-click on the build you want to load.

## Save Modified Build

If you did changes to an already saved build and want to save it to the same build use the **Save** option.
If you want to save it as a new build use the **Save As** option. 
You can also change the name/note on a build by right-clicking it.

**(Advanced)** In this window you can also inspect,
change and remove item data, keep in mind that it is raw data so only change if
you know what you are doing.

# Items and Gems

Now that you have a nice Skill tree, it is time to add some items and gems to calculate your DPS and defences.

*This feature require you to download data from pathofexile.com!*

## Setup character

To get item and gem data we are going to access one of your characters from pathofexile.com.
This character needs be equiped with the items and gems that you want for your build, so head over
to the client and fix that.
